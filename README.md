# UBlox GNSS
Driver for the u-blox M* GNSS receivers.

## How to use
This driver returns location information as provided by the device.  It attempts
do do this for all ublox devices.  In the simplest use case, the driver will
continually update a 'location' object, which can be queried by the user as
required.

#### Advanced use cases
There are other features and information that these devices can provide.
Accessing additional information is based on sending messages to and from the
device.  The driver allows the user to send/recieve messages to the device.  The
'Advanced examples' below show how to use the mesage system via this driver to
collect information from any of the implemented message types.  The information
they can provide is vast, and not all types may have human readable output.  It
is up to the user to look at the device manual and determine which messages are
required, how to interpret the data, and to construct the message to send via
the driver to ask for it.

## Interface and Port Support
These IC's come with pins for different types of connectivity.  According to the
datasheets, the devices can have the following 'ports' configured.:
- UART1
- UART2
- I2C
- SPI
- USB

| Interface | Support |
|-|-|
| I2C | Supported. [Toit code example.](https://github.com/toitware/ublox-gnss-driver/blob/main/examples/i2c.toit) |
| Serial | Supported. [Toit code example.](https://github.com/toitware/ublox-gnss-driver/blob/main/examples/serial.toit) |
| SPI | Supported. [Toit code example.]() |

## Devices Tested
This driver aims to support all UBX-compatible devices, though coverage is
limited by the hardware and chipsets available to us for testing.  The code was
first written for the M8 device, with others added later.

If you have a device that isn’t listed and can donate one, or help with
testing, please [get in touch](https://discord.gg/Q7Y9VQ5nh2) or open an issue —
contributions and reports are very welcome.

Devices and their reported HW/SW/PROTVER versions are listed below:
| Device | HW Version | 'ROM CORE' (SW-VER) | Minumum UBX Protocol Version | From Toit Driver Version | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| M8 | - | - | `15.00`  | >`1.2.0` | Originally written to support this device. |
| `NEO-7M-0-000` | `00070000` | >`1.00 (59842) Jun 27 2012` | `14.0` | `1.3.0` | Operational, undergoing testing. |
| `NEO-6M-0-001` | `00040007` | >`7.03 (45969) Mar 17 2011` | `14.0` (Assumed, device does not advertise  extensions)  | `1.3.0` | Operational, undergoing testing. |

## Protocol Support
Driver uses the [`ubx-message`](https://github.com/toitware/ubx-message) protocol, parser to
handle parsing messages from the ublox device.  The devices also support other
open protocols, which will be developed as needed.
| Protocol | Support | Notes |
|-|-|-|
|  [`ubx-message`](https://github.com/toitware/ubx-message)  | Yes | Binary, Open but proprietary.  Originally written alongside this driver in support of the M8 device.  |
| `NMEA` | Not yet. | ASCII text sentences (e.g., GGA, RMC) widely used for basic GNSS output.  Widely supported on ublox devices. |
| `RTCM` | Not yet. | Standard for GNSS differential/RTK correction messages. u-blox M8 documentation mentions RTCM, however F9M features full support. |


## Specific tasks

### Switch UART to different baud rate
Whilst the serial driver is established at a specific speed, both the
device/driver needs to be set to the required speed **using the old speed**.
Once done, reconnect the uart at the new speed.  This driver does not save this
configuration, so each power on, the device should be at the default 9600 baud.
(If the device has a different default, adjust the code accordingly.)
```Toit
DEFAULT-BAUD := 9600
TARGET-BAUD  := 115200

// Make connection with default baud rate, initialise driver
port := uart.Port --tx=TX-PIN --rx=RX-PIN --baud-rate=DEFAULT-BAUD
driver := ublox-gnss.Driver port.in port.out --auto-run=false

// Tell the device to use a different baud, and shut down the driver
driver.set-uart --baud=TARGET-BAUD
driver.close

// Restart the connection at the newer baud rate, reinitialise driver
port = uart.Port --tx=TX-PIN --rx=RX-PIN --baud-rate=TARGET-BAUD
driver = ublox-gnss.Driver port.in port.out
```
> [!TIP]
> If debugging and rerunning code repeatedly without power resets in between,
> the device may stay at the higher speed from the previous run.  If your code
> starts with the assumption of a specific speed, unless the device has been
> power-reset, it may still be operating as configured during the previous code
> execution.

### Getting time synchronisation from GPS
This is best done using the a provided pin. Some modules do not expose this pin
to the user, in which case, an averaging method is provided.

#### Method 1: Using the TIMEPULSE Pin
This pin (often labeled TP, TP1, or TIMEPULSE / PPS) pin on u-blox GNSS modules
is a precision timing output, most commonly used for 1 Hz pulse-per-second (PPS)
synchronization.  The pin outputs a square wave that’s aligned to GNSS time
(usually GPS time or UTC).  Its rising (or falling) edge can be used as a
precise timing reference.
```Toit
//todo: complete this example
// Idea - have the user connect a pin to the TIMEPULSE/PPS pin on the driver.
// Expose and send a UBX-CFG-TP5 message [done], controlling:
// - Frequency (0.25 Hz – 10 MHz, module-dependent)
// - Duty cycle (percentage high)
// - Time reference (GPS, UTC, GLONASS, etc.)
// - Alignment edge (rising/falling)
// - Behavior when GNSS fix is lost (hold last, switch to free-run, disable)
// - Polarity (active high / low)
// Then have the driver use the pin and set time with it only if/when
// drift exceeds a certain amount.  Check with Florian that there isn't
// something already made that could make this significantly easier.

```

#### Method 2: Averaging method
When `UBX-NAV-TIMEUTC` messages are received, they are first checked for
validity (eg `.valid-utc=true`).  If valid, the driver immediately measures
the time offset between the time message and the local system time.  As these
messages are continually received, a moving average is calculated with them in
order to smooth out time differences/delays of local processing.  This average
is exposed via the driver, and with that the system time can be set, as shown:
```Toit
//todo: complete this example
// Idea - First, clean up serial, increase speed[done], disable chatty NMEA messages[done].
// When time is valid, obtain accuracy, and a smart allowance for serialisation
// time.  Calculate a time asdjustment and let the user set their time if necessary.





```
> [!WARNING] For historical reasons, GPS time is measured as time since
> `1980-01-06T00:00:00Z`.  It was 'week 0' when the system went live.  When they
> are subscribed, `NavTimeUtc` messages will always return a UTC time value.
> However, if sufficient information has not yet been obtained to give accurate
> time, the time will be Week 0 plus current uptime (in seconds).  `NavTimeUtc`
> messages also have a boolean called `valid-utc` which will become `true` when the
> device is able to provide accurate time.

The uBlox manual additionally states:
> [!INFORMATION]
> Customers attaching u-blox receivers to simulators should be aware that GPS
> time is referenced to 6th January 1980, GLONASS to 1st January 1996, Galileo
> to 22nd August 1999 and BeiDou to 1st January 2006.  The receiver cannot be
> expected to work reliably with signals that appear to come from before these
> dates.
